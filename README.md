- ### e2e tests:
  - ##### Core: _Check if each functionality of a TODO list app is working._

    | :-----------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    |            Add items            | ðŸ”¹Type some tasks in `text-input`.<br /> ðŸ”¸ Each item should appear inside `todo-list`.                                                                                                                                                     |
    |          Rename items           | ðŸ”¹Double click on any item`(".view")`. This should replace the inner elements with an input element`("[data-testid=text-input]")`. <br /> ðŸ”¹Clear the input element and type something new. <br />ðŸ”¸Selected item should have the new name. |
    |          Delete items           | ðŸ”¹Hover on a item, so that the `destroy` button reveals itself. <br/> ðŸ”¹Click on the X button. <br /> ðŸ”¸Total count of `todo-items` should decrease by one.                                                                                 |
    |  **Toggle items:** Check items  | ðŸ”¹Check the `todo-item-toggle` button for couple of items. <br /> ðŸ”¸Each of those checked items should have the `completed` class.                                                                                                          |
    | **Toggle items:** Uncheck items | ðŸ”¹Uncheck items that already have `completed` class. <br />ðŸ”¸None of the `todo-item` should have the `completed` class now.                                                                                                                 |
  - ##### Validation: _Check if the inputs are being validated before appending to the list._
    | Test Case                                    | Implementation Details                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | only accept items with length greater than 1 | ðŸ”¹Type these into the input box: **"", "a", "ab"**. <br/> ðŸ”¸First two should not be added to the `todo-list`. <br/> ðŸ”¸Last text should be added to the list.                           |
    | only rename items with length greater than 1 | ðŸ”¹Select any item from the list. <br/> ðŸ”¹Try to rename the current item with these: **"", "a", "item 2"** <br/> ðŸ”¸Only the final attempt should be successfull.                        |
    | render text with special characters          | ðŸ”¹Add texts that has **[", ', /, &, <, >]** in it. <br/> ðŸ”¸The text in `todo-item` should appear as expected.                                                                          |
    | **Extra space:** Leading spaces              | ðŸ”¹Enter a text with a lot of spaces appended before it. <br/> ðŸ”¹Rename it with any other text that has leading space. <br/> ðŸ”¸In both cases, the text should not start with spaces.    |
    | **Extra space:** Trailing spaces             | ðŸ”¹Enter a text with a lot of spaces appended after it. <br/> ðŸ”¹Rename it with any other text that has trailing space. <br/> ðŸ”¸In both cases, the text should not end with spaces.      |
    | **Extra space:** Wide spaces                 | ðŸ”¹Enter a text that has more than one space between two words. <br/> ðŸ”¹Rename it with any other text with wide space. <br/> ðŸ”¸In both cases, the text should not have repeated spaces. |
  - ##### Behaviour: _Check if other components are working as expected._
